/// The unload-safe boundary exists because API Explorer and the OpenAPI document service retain an
/// endpoint's request and response <see cref="System.Type"/> for the host service-provider lifetime.
/// A runtime that never builds an OpenAPI document has no such retention: a collectible contract type
/// published as endpoint metadata is released with its endpoint generation. Enforcing the boundary
/// there rejects a candidate for a risk that is not present.
/// <para>
/// Enforcement is on by default, so a host that documents its endpoints is protected without opting
/// in and an unconfigured host never silently loses the guard. A host that does not register an
/// OpenAPI document service may suppress it with
/// <see cref="MinimalEndpointsServiceCollectionExtensions.SuppressEndpointLifetimeEnforcement"/>.
