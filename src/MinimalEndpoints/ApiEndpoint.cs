/// A self-describing HTTP endpoint: one class carrying its route, verb, metadata, and handling.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// The class declares its route and verb with an attribute such as <c>[Post("definitions")]</c> and
/// refines anything dynamic — body mode, status codes, permissions — by overriding
/// <see cref="Configure"/>. Registration is explicit and module-local: the owning module maps its
/// endpoint classes from its own assembly at composition time. There is no process-global discovery
/// and no static registry, which is what made previous endpoint frameworks unloadable; scanning a
/// module's own assembly inside its own mapping call retains nothing beyond the endpoint generation.
/// <para>
/// <see cref="Configure"/> is invoked once at mapping time on an uninitialized instance, so it must
/// not touch constructor-injected state. Handling instances are created per request from the request
/// services, so constructor injection works as it does for any scoped service.
